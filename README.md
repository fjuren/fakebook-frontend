This personal project is meant to help me practice web debelopment and try out new technologies.

Fakebook is a fun spin on Facebook and is an attempt to recreate some of Facebook's functionality.

This repository is the project's frontend; [See Fakebook's backend API here](https://github.com/fjuren/fakebook-api) in a separate repo.
